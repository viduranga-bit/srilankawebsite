                <p>Sri Lanka was formerly known as Ceylon when it gained its independence in 1948. The country has ever since been plagued by the violent disruptions caused by the Sinhalese majority and Tamil separatists. The decades long civil war between the government and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has affected the country’s progress to a large extent.
                    <br><br>The end of the civil war has clearly helped stabilize the economic growth in 2010 and 2011, especially after the financial downturn of 2009. The GDP of Sri Lanka was $118 billion in 2011.

                    The natural resources of Sri Lanka include graphite, mineral sands, limestone, phosphates, and gems. The mining sector does not play a significant role in the country’s economy.
                    <br><br>Sri Lanka has many industrial minerals such as dolomite, feldspar, ball clay, kaolin, calcite, gemstones, mica, mineral sands, graphite, limestone, phosphate rock, quartz, and silica sand.
                    In 2011, the country did not produce any metals or crude oil. It relied on imported petroleum for refining.
                    <br><br>In 2011, Sri Lanka had a cement shortage situation due to the increase in demand, hence began importing cement from Indonesia, Pakistan, and Malaysia.

                    In the same year, Holcim Ltd. of Switzerland made plans to expand the grinding capacity of its cement plants and also to construct a new cement plant. Holcim (Lanka) Ltd. a subsidiary of Holcim operated a 1-million-Mt/yr-capacity cement plant at Puttalam. It also operated a grinding plant at Galle.
                    
                    Sri Lanka has an array of gemstone deposits. The Highland Complex in the country is known for its high-grade metamorphic land rich in gemstones.
                    
                    The two major graphite producers in the country are Bogala Graphite Lanka plc and Kahatagaha Graphite Lanka Ltd. The combined production capacity of the two companies amounted to about 11,000 t/yr in 2011.
                    <br><br>The government of Sri Lanka is working towards better economic growth and has implemented many government reforms and policies to encourage private (foreign and domestic) investment so as to develop the impoverished areas of the country.

                    Experts believe that the discovery of natural gas in the Mannar Basin will persuade the government to start issuing permits for oil and gas exploration in the near future.
                    
                    Recent reports state that Sri Lanka’s gem and jewelry industry is heading towards becoming a global gem trading zone in the coming years. The industry currently is hoping to earn $600 million this year. The amount of gem reserves in the country is likely to ensure that Sri Lanka’s gem market reaches $ 1billion by 2016.
                    
                    Another piece of positive news for Sri Lanka's mining sector is that the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau plans to use an airborne geophysical survey system to help locate the concealed mineral resources around the country.

               <p>Currently positioned in the global market as the most important source of high quality sapphires, the Island has built her reputation as one of the finest gem cutting and finishing centres in the world, offering gem stones that meet the highest international standards.

                Sri Lanka is blessed with over 70 varieties of coloured stones out of the 200 found in the world and is among the five most important gem-bearing nations. The country’s breath-taking natural heritage comprises of varieties of gem minerals, which includes Blue, Pink, Yellow and Golden Sapphires, Rubies, Padmaradchas, Star Sapphires, Star Rubies, Alexandrite, Cat’s F, Spinel, Aquamarines, Topaz, Zircons, Garnets, Tourmalines, Moonstones, Quartz and a large number of rare gemstones.Sri Lankan Gem Suppliers & Dealers take immense pride in the fact that Sri Lanka is the world’s choice for calibrated and fancy cut gemstones, high value single stones and quality service cutting.
                
               <br><br> Amongst the outstanding gemstones that Sri Lanka has produced in the contemporary era are the Blue Giant of the Orient (466 cts), Logan Blue Sapphire (423 cts), Blue Belle of Asia (400 cts), Rossar Reeves Star Ruby (138.7 cts), Star of Lanka (393 cts. Star Sapphire) and Ray of Treasure (105 cts. Cat’s Eye). The first three gemstones are on display at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC, USA.
                
                <br><br> The Blue Sapphire or Ceylon Sapphire is Sri Lanka’s gem supreme, the origin of a 30 year fashion trend. The author Richard Hughes describes it thus the color of certain Ceylon blues has an ocular attack unlike any other in the sapphire world. It slashes the eye like a razor. Such stones have that which makes electric blue “electric, and in the Island of Gems are often compared to the blue portion of a peacock’s feather”.
                
                Sri Lanka’s Gem Industry consists of free size and investment gemstones, calibrated gemstones, rare gemstones and gem cutting services. Abundance of gemstones is mined in Sri Lanka or imported freely into the country.
                
                International standards lapidaries coupled with a skilled workforce adds lustre to Sri Lanka’s coloured gemstones making it the better alternative for calibrated and fancy cut gemstones, high-value single stones and quality service cutting.
                
                Charting the legendary history of the Ceylon Sapphire takes a traveler through such exclusive arenas as Royal Weddings, the HMS Titanic, and the red carpet of Hollywood.
                
               <br><br> Kate Middleton wears a blue Ceylon Sapphire engagement ring, which Prince William famously exchanged to seal his love for her. The iconic gem was picked out by the late Princess Diana of Wales for her own engagement in 1981. The US$ 500,000 piece is an oval cut, 12-carat Ceylon Sapphire - of a particularly vivid shade of Cornflower Blue.
                
                In 1997, for the premiere of the blockbuster movie Titanic, Asprey & Garrard, the same London jewellers who created Princess Diana’s engagement ring, designed a real “Heart of the Ocean” necklace. The result was a platinum-set, 170-carat heart-shaped Ceylon Sapphire surrounded by a row of 65 round diamonds, totaling 36 carats and valued at over £2.1 million.
                
                <br><br> The gravels of Sri Lanka’s gem bearing land hold the greatest concentration of gems on Earth. Out of the 65,525 square kilometres that makes up Sri Lanka’s land area, 90% is estimated as potential gem bearing land. Among the five major gem producing areas in Sri Lanka, Ratnapura or the “City of Gems” is the most prolific gem producing area. To this date, no place on earth has surpassed Sri Lanka’s seemingly endless supply of large, high quality precious gemstones.
                
                Lapidaries employing cutting edge technologies coupled with a highly skilled workforce, are geared to produces for the mass markets as well as the high-end luxury markets and even for the exclusive jeweled watch industry, meeting the highest international standards at each level, adds luster to Sri Lanka’s coloured gemstones. Sri Lanka is the world’s choice for calibrated and fancy cut gemstones, high value single stones and quality service cutting.
                
                Gem dealers in Sri Lanka were instrumental in founding the International Colored Gemstone Association (ICA) in 1984, which is now the apex body for the global industry. Sri Lanka plays a leading role in regulating and promoting international gem trade through the ICA.</p>
